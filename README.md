# myFirstApp-CSGO-Wallhack-2015
My first 'real' app. I was 18 and i really used to game at that time. So, i decided to make a hack. This is where it all begun and  probably got me so in love with programming.  

**Back in time 8 years ago.**  

*If i remember correctly i was 10th grade that time. Though i was enrolled in mathematics - informatics highschool, we didn't had access to advanced courses of informatics, just basic stuff. I really wanted more so i started to learn by myself C++. I was so hooked in the process that i decided to make an app that has a scope. At that time i really loved gaming (haven't played a game ever since)  so therefore why not make a hack for CS:GO game?*   

*So i made some accounts on different hacking platforms, asking question and learning. In a few weeks i managed to get it working. I was so happy that something i made helped me to gain (unfair) advantage in a game (see players through walls), so it had a meaning.Knowing where the enemy players are gives a huge advantage. Even made it public on the same forums that i learned from and gain some really cool feedback. People actually loved it and used it a while.*  

*I maintained the code till 2015 - finished highschool, when i finally realized playing games was getting me nowwhere and it was a waste of time and i needed to do something with my life*  

*Reading all the forum post thanking me really got me going and made me love programming.*

*I actually managed to found a demo on my old pc :)*

*I also tried to find the source code all i found was a draft message in my yahoo inbox with a draft version of the code, which i uploaded in this repo. Probably doesn't compile though i remember working at this point. HackProcess.h library was a standard hooking process that i found on web for a game then adapted for my game in order to hook the hack to csgo.exe process. Actual hack logic is in wow.cpp*
